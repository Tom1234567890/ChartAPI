# The ChartAPI Vision
This project aims to provide a way for the public to prove and disprove assertions using their own facts.

This will be done by taking large amounts of data (E.G. The UK's census) and allowing users to filter down this data into what they deem relevant. 

Once the user has the data they are interested they need to be able to analyze the data. This means applying statistical analysis to the data in order to obtain a particular fact, while still remaining as user friendly as posisble.

# Current Features:
- Line chart. (Series chart)

  This chart allows for the exposure of trends over the course of several different data points.
  While this is not directly related to the vision, it serves as a good starting point to get working.
- Proportion chart. (Comparison chart)

  This chart allows for the comparison of directly linked data, for instance it can show prevalence of types of crime.
  Essentially a linear pie chart, however I have a personal bias against pie charts so this is what you get.
- Scatter Graph. (Series chart)

  This chart allows for the plotting of points ready for analysis using other areas of the product.
  Simmilar to the line chart, however the lines need to be drawn according to correlation.
- Line of best fit (Widget)

  This allows users to detect correlation in their data, expose the trend on the chart itself or within the widget and furthermore provide analysis to the validity of the correlation.
- Filtering Capabilities

  Drill down to the data that matters by selecting series titles, removing any interfearence.
