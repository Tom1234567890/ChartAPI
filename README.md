#The ChartAPI Vision
This project aims to provide a way for the public to prove and disprove assertions using their own facts.

This will be done by taking large amounts of data (E.G. The UK's census) and allowing users to filter down this data into what they deem relevant. 

Once the user has the data they are interested they need to be able to analyze the data. This means applying statistical analysis to the data in order to obtain a particular fact, while still remaining as user friendly as posisble.
#The Story

I personally found Brexit to be the most infuriating politics I have had ever witnessed.

Both sides of the argument used blatant misinformation and fear in order to muscle the public into a decision they may have not understood fully, a practice that should be condemned to the history books.

I disagree with this type of politics to the extent I am willing to fight it here. I want the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

This is a tool that will be used to fact check statements. This is a tool that can be used to make your own mind about difficult issues and enable you to share the facts that lead to your opinions.

It's not good enough to simply be told “Crime is at an all time high”. We need to know how accurate this is. We need to know what crimes are becoming a bigger issue, and if our government are taking steps to combat it. Then voters will be able to make a decision on a factual basis, rather than on a gut feeling.

#Current Features:
- Line chart. (First single-series / multi-series chart)
  This chart allows for the exposure of trends over the course of several different data points.
  While this is not directly related to the vision, it serves as a good starting point to get working.
- Proportion chart. (Comparison chart)
  This chart allows for the comparison of directly linked data, for instance it can show prevalence of types of crime.
  Essentially a linear pie chart, however I have a personal bias against pie charts so this is what you get.

##Actively worked on

##The Wishlist
- Create Filtering Widget. (Way to split grouped data into it's components. E.G: Split "Total population by year" into "Population by year and age")
- Allow for the sharing of filtered results.
- Create Scatter Graph.
- User guide for the API :(
- Implement Variable X Axis into all charts.
- Create Correlation Widget
- Create Testing website
- Allow for Ajax calls to be made for live data.
