#The ChartAPI Vision
This project aims to provide a way for the public to prove and disprove assertions using their own facts.

This will be done by taking large amounts of data (E.G. The UK's census) and allowing users to filter down this data into what matters. Once the user has the data they are interested they need to be able to analyze the data. This means applying statistical analysis to the data in order to obtain a particular fact.
#Current Features:
- Basic Chart Layout.
- ...

##Actively worked on
- Create line chart. (First single-series / multi-series chart)

##The Wishlist
- Create proportion chart. (Single-series chart)
- Create Filtering Widget. (Way to split grouped data into it's components. E.G: Split "Total population by year" into "Population by year and age")
- Allow for the sharing of filtered results.
- Create Testing website
- Allow for Ajax calls to be made for live data.

#The Story
I personally found Brexit to be the most infuriating politics I have had ever witnessed.

Both sides of the argument used blatant misinformation and fear in order to muscle the public into a decision they may have not understood fully.

I disagree with this type of politics to the extent I am willing to fight it here. I want the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

This is a tool that will be used to prevent misinformation being provided. This is a tool that can be used to make your own mind about difficult issues and enable you to share the facts that lead to your opinions.

Hopefully this is also a tool that will allow for users to challenge their assertions. By providing statistical analysis we can challenge illogical beliefs.
